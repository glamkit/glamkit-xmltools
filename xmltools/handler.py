    In subclasses, define nodes, mapping of CSS-style selectors to callables:
    
    nodes = (
        node('topElement > Organisation', org_callable, **kwargs),
        node('topElement > Person[id="person-345"]', person_345_callable, **kwargs),
        node('topElement > Work', work_callable, **kwargs),
        ...
    )
    
    Only the value of the *final* matching callable is returned to the parent, so normally you want to do saving.
    
    Define pre_ and post_harvest handlers if you need. The post_harvest handler in particular should operate on as few records as possible, in order to make incremental changes feasible. (pre_ and post_harvest handlers quite often call similarly-named handlers in callable classes).
    
    Then call .process(files). Every time a selector is matched (in top-to-bottom order), the elem, and kwargs, will be passed to the corresponding callable.
    
    Each callable should:    
        1) handle the contents of XML elem.
        2) Log for itself that the handle has happened (e.g. for post-batch-handle cleaning, etc).
        3) Return constants.DO_NOT_DISCARD if the memory taken by this elem is NOT to be freed up after the callable is called - ie another handler should run on the same data.
